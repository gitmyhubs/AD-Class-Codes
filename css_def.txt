#   Introduction to CSS:-
    ->CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.
    ->CSS is used to design HTML tags.
    ->CSS is a widely used language on the web.
    ->HTML, CSS and JavaScript are used for web designing. It helps the web designers to apply 
        style on HTML tags.
  
#   What is CSS:-
    CSS stands for Cascading style sheets. It describes to the user how to display HTML 
    elements on the screen in a proper format. CSS is the language that is used to style
    HTML documents. In simple words, cascading style sheets are a language used to simplify 
    the process of making a webpage.

    CSS is used to handle some parts of the webpage. With the help of CSS, we can control 
    the colour of text and style of fonts, and we can control the spacing between the paragraph
    and many more things. CSS is easy to understand but provides strong control on the Html 
    documents.CSS is combined with HTML.

#   Advantages of CSS:-

    => Faster page speed: It has a faster page speed than other code's page speeds.
    With the help of the CSS rule, we can apply it to all occurrences of certain
    tags in HTML documents.

    => Better user experience: CSS makes a webpage very attractive to the eyes. Also,
    CSS makes it user-friendly. When the button or text is in a proper format, 
    it improves the user experience.

    => Quicker Development time: With the help of CSS, we can specify the format and style 
    the multiple pages into one code string. In cascading style sheet, we can make a 
    duplicate copy of several website pages

    => If we make a webpage, it has the same formatting, looks, and feel, so with the help 
    of the CSS rule for one page, and it is sufficient for all the pages.

    => Easy Formatting changes: In CSS, if we need to make changes in the format, 
        it is very easy; we only need to change the one-page format it will automatically 
        apply to the other pages of CSS.

        There is no need to correct individual pages in a CSS style sheet. If we fix a CSS
        style sheet, it will automatically update the other CSS style sheet.

    => Compatibility: Compatibility is very important in today's age. If we create any webpage,
        it should be very responsive and user-friendly. CSS is used with Html to make webpage 
        design responsive.

CSS Syntax:

# Types Of CSS:
1. Inline CSS
2. Internal CSS
3. External CSS

1. Inline CSS:- Inline CSS is used to style the elements of HTML documents. It is used in HTML
    to style the attribute without using the selectors. It is challenging to manage the inline
function in websites compared to other types. It is very helpful in HTML in some situations.

example:- 
        <p style="color: blue;">

2. Internal CSS:- Internal CSS is used to design the style single page effectively. It is
more time-consuming because we can only work on one page or we need to style each web page.
In Internal CSS, we style a single webpage uniquely.

syntax: <style>
           your css code here.....
        </style>

3. External CSS:- The Exaternal Style sheet is generally used when you want to make changes
                    on multiple pages. It is ideal for this condition because it facilitates
                    you to change the look of the entire web site by changing just on file.

                    It uses the <link> tag on every pages and the <link> tag should be put
                    inside the head section.

                    The extension of css is .css, The file name should save in .css format.
                    example: style.css
