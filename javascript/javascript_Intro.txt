# What is JavaScript:
------------------------------
=>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.

=>It is commonly used to create dynamic and interactive elements in web applications.

=>Designed for creating network-centric applications.

=>Complementary to and integrated with Java and HTML.

=>Open and cross-platform

=>Using JavaScript we can change the HTML Elements behaviour.

JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language that we can use for client-side or server-side development. It is a dynamically typed programming language, which means that we donâ€™t care about variable data types while writing the JavaScript code. Also, it contains the control statements, operators, and objects like Array, Math, Data, etc.

Note:- 
-> We can write javascript code in <script></script> tag

-> Or we can write javascript code in external file for example "example.js"

-> the extension of javascript will be ".js"

# Features of JavaScript:
---------------------------
=> All popular web browsers support JavaScript as they provide built-in execution environments.

=> JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming language. Thus, it is a structured programming language.

=> JavaScript is a weakly typed language, where certain types are implicitly cast (depending on the operation).

=> JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that uses prototypes rather than using classes for inheritance.

=> It is a light-weighted and interpreted language.

=> It is a case-sensitive language.

=> JavaScript is supportable in several operating systems including, Windows, macOS, etc.

=> It provides good control to the users over the web browsers.
