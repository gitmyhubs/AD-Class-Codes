# What is JavaScript:
------------------------------
=>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.
=>It is commonly used to create dynamic and interactive elements in web applications.
=>Designed for creating network-centric applications.
=>Complementary to and integrated with Java and HTML.
=>Open and cross-platform
=>Using JavaScript we can change the HTML Elements behaviour.

JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language that we can use for client-side or server-side development. It is a dynamically typed programming language, which means that we donâ€™t care about variable data types while writing the JavaScript code. Also, it contains the control statements, operators, and objects like Array, Math, Data, etc.

Note:- 
-> We can write javascript code in <script></script> tag

-> Or we can write javascript code in external file for example "example.js"

-> the extension of javascript will be ".js"

# Features of JavaScript:
---------------------------
=> All popular web browsers support JavaScript as they provide built-in execution environments.

=> JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming language. Thus, it is a structured programming language.

=> JavaScript is a weakly typed language, where certain types are implicitly cast (depending on the operation).

=> JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that uses prototypes rather than using classes for inheritance.

=> It is a light-weighted and interpreted language.

=> It is a case-sensitive language.

=> JavaScript is supportable in several operating systems including, Windows, macOS, etc.

=> It provides good control to the users over the web browsers.

# Applications of JavaScript:
-----------------------------------
JavaScript is used to create interactive websites. It is mainly used for:

-> Client-side validation
-> Dynamic drop-down menus
-> Displaying date and time
-> Displaying pop-up windows and dialog boxes (like an alert dialog box, confirm dialog box 
    and prompt dialog box)
-> Displaying clocks etc.

JavaScript Example:
<script>  
    document.write("Hello AD Class");  
</script>  

# JavaScript Comment:
------------------------
advantage:
-> To make code easy to understand
-> To avoid the unnecessary code

1. Single-line Comment
2. Multi-line Comment

# JavaScript Variable:
-------------------------------------
A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location. There are two types of variables in JavaScript : 
local variable and global variable.

There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers).:
1. Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign.
2. After first letter we can use digits (0 to 9), for example value1.
3. JavaScript variables are case sensitive, for example x and X are different variables.

=> Javascript Local Variable:
A JavaScript local variable is declared inside block or function. It is accessible within the function or block only.

=> Javascript Global Variable:
A JavaScript global variable is accessible from any function. A variable i.e. declared outside the function or declared with window object is known as global variable.
