# CSS Justify-Content Property:
-------------------------------
he CSS property justify-content indicates how the flexible box container is aligned. 
It includes the area between and around content items along a flex container's main axis 
spread across a browser.

Syntax:
justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between|  space-around 
                | space-evenly | initial | inherit;  

Flex-start: The default setting for aligning flex elements from the beginning of the 
            container is flex-start.

Inherit:    The elements are arranged according to the value of their inherited parent element.

Flex-end:   It aligns flex elements at the container's end.

Center:     The container's center is where the flex elements are aligned.

Space-between: Flex items are arranged with equal spacing, with the first thing pushed to 
                the front and the final item pushed to the back.

Space-around: The flexible elements are positioned before, between, and after each other,
                and the corners with equal spacing.

Space-evenly: The items are arranged uniformly in space, but the distances from the 
                corners differ.
